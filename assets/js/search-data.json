            "content": "Program Purpose and Function . What is the requirement? . We must be able to run the program and showcase inputs, program functionality, and outputs. | . Did we meet this expectation? YEP . On our pages we have a way to acess our programs purpose and function [insert photo of page or link] | You can also see our code in the backend that makes our snake game possible! | . Data Abstraction . What is the requirement? . We must include two different code segments: -Data stored in a list and using this data to fulfill the programs purpose | We also have to describe what the data represents in terms of our program | . Did we meet this expectation? I HOPE SO . We created an API that will represent all the frequently asked questions about our game [insert photo of page or link] | This creates a stress-free and relaxing experience for you and the rest of our users, fulfilling our goal and making everyone happy! | . Managing Complexity . What is the requirement? . using a code segment that shows that we used a list to manage complexity | Answering why does this list contribute to the program code. | . Did we meet this expectation? YES . We used this API of the frequently asked questions to manage difficulties and create efficiency in our program [insert photo of page or link] | Without this API our data would not be interactable | . Procedural Abstraction . What is the requirement? . The inputs having effects on the outputs | The procedure should be defined in the code for the function of our project | . Did we meet this expectation? OF COURSE . On example of us using procedural abstraction is linking the arrow keys to how the snake moves and which way it moves. [insert photo of page or link] | Without this procedure the snake could not move and capture the block targets | . Algorithm Implementation . What is the requirement? . Includes a program code segment of a student-developed algorithm that includes: sequencing, selection, and iteration | Explains in detailed steps how the algorithm works | . Did we meet this expectation? DUH . We can explain to you the code we used and how each step contributes to what you see in our snake game | . Testing . What is the requirement? . describe what is being tested in each step | identify result of each call | . Did we meet this expectation? YOU TELL US . test our snake game and ask us all the questions you want friends!! | . Hope you enjoyed the Friendship Table Project .",
